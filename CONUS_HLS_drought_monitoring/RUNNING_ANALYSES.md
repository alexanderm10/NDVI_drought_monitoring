# Currently Running Analyses

## Status: RUNNING — 2025 NDVI processing (single clean instance)

### Pipeline: 2025 NDVI Processing — Docker
- **Status**: RUNNING — chunk 15/58 (~25%), resuming from ~40% complete (skip-if-exists)
- **Script**: `process_bulk_ndvi_docker.R 2025 --workers=8` (launched directly, not via orchestrator)
- **Log**: `bulk_downloads/logs/process_2025_docker_restart.log`
- **Container**: `conus-hls-drought-monitor`
- **Workers**: 8 parallel R workers
- **Error rate**: 0.06% (3 errors in chunk 14 — corrupt NASA source files)
- **Zombie fix**: Container now uses `init: true` (tini as PID 1) — zombies are reaped properly

### Resource Usage
- **Workers**: 8 R workers
- **System**: 48 CPUs, ~200GB RAM available
- **Zombies**: 0 (verified — tini reaping works)

## Monitoring

### Custom Agent
A `download-monitor` agent at `.claude/agents/download-monitor.md`. In Claude Code, ask "check on my downloads" to trigger it.

### Manual Monitoring
```bash
# Processing log
tail -f CONUS_HLS_drought_monitoring/bulk_downloads/logs/process_2025_docker_restart.log

# Docker container health
docker exec conus-hls-drought-monitor ps aux | grep -E "[R]script|[w]get"

# Check for zombies (should stay at 0)
docker exec conus-hls-drought-monitor ps aux | grep -c defunct

# File counts
for yr in 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025; do
  echo -n "$yr: "
  ls /mnt/malexander/datasets/ndvi_monitor/processed_ndvi/daily/$yr/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l
done
```

## Session Summary (Mar 30, 2026)

### Work Completed
1. **Diagnosed competing processes**: Two `process_bulk_ndvi_docker.R 2025` instances (PID 54544 with 4 workers, PID 455930 with 8 workers) were racing on same data — ~28% error rate from write collisions
2. **Verified 2024 complete**: 254,497 NDVI files, 32 errors (all corrupt NASA source), 0 truncated files
3. **Fixed zombie root cause**: Added `init: true` to `docker-compose.yml` — PID 1 is now `docker-init` (tini) which properly reaps zombies. Cleared 1,009 accumulated zombies
4. **Updated safe_shutdown.sh**: Truncated file check now covers both 2024 and 2025 directories
5. **Clean restart**: Rebuilt container (`docker compose down/up`), restored `.netrc`, launched single `process_bulk_ndvi_docker.R 2025 --workers=8`
6. **Verified clean operation**: 0 zombies, 0.06% error rate (down from 28%), 8 workers active

### Key Fix: Zombie Root Cause Resolution
The long-standing zombie problem was caused by Docker's PID 1 being `tail -f /dev/null`, which never calls `wait()`. Adding `init: true` to `docker-compose.yml` injects `tini` as PID 1, which properly reaps all child processes. This is a permanent fix — no more zombie accumulation regardless of how R workers exit.

### Files Modified
- `docker-compose.yml`: Added `init: true`
- `safe_shutdown.sh`: Extended truncated file check to include 2025

## Session Summary (Mar 27, 2026 — afternoon)

### Work Completed
1. **Status check**: 2024 at chunk 29/51 (~55%), 2025 download 92% complete (L30 done, S30 missing 182 tiles in zones 17-19)
2. **Restarted 2025 S30 prefetch**: Resumed `getHLS_bands.sh` to finish remaining ~24K S30 granules
3. **Launched parallel 2025 NDVI processing**: Started `process_bulk_ndvi_docker.R 2025 --workers=4` alongside ongoing 2024 (8 workers) — 12 total workers, plenty of headroom on 48-CPU/251GB system

---

## Session Summary (Mar 27, 2026 — morning)

### Work Completed
1. **Container restart**: Restarted `conus-hls-drought-monitor` after machine maintenance shutdown
2. **Re-copied `.netrc`**: Earthdata auth credentials restored inside container
3. **Fixed NDVI skip threshold**: Raised `NDVI_COMPLETE_THRESHOLD` from 100k to 180k — old threshold was incorrectly skipping 2024 (152k files, only ~55% complete)
4. **Narrowed year loop**: Changed `bulk_download_docker.sh` to iterate only 2024-2025 (2019-2023 confirmed complete) — avoids ~5 min of slow CIFS file counting per completed year
5. **Added download-monitor permissions**: Added Bash permissions for `echo`, `tail`, `grep`, `df`, `head`, `cat` to `settings.local.json` so the download-monitor agent can run its diagnostic commands

Docker PID 1 zombie root cause identified. Extended bulk download to 2025. Shelved R-based CONUS download.

### Feb 16 — Parallel stability pattern
Fixed `FutureInterruptError` with worker recycling: fresh `plan()` per chunk, `tryCatch` + sequential fallback, `gc()` cleanup.

### Feb 12 — Docker migration
Moved bulk download into Docker container. Created `download-monitor` agent.

## Key Notes for Next Session

- **`.netrc` is ephemeral**: Re-copy after container rebuild/restart: `docker cp ~/.netrc conus-hls-drought-monitor:/.netrc`
- **Zombie fix is permanent**: `init: true` in docker-compose.yml — no manual cleanup needed
- **NFS mount may drop on crash**: Check with `df -h /mnt/malexander/datasets/ndvi_monitor/` — should show 316TB CIFS mount, not local `/dev/sda1`
- **Docker bind mounts go stale after NFS remount**: Must restart container to pick up remounted filesystem
- **2025 processing will auto-resume**: skip-if-exists logic means a restart just skips already-processed granules
